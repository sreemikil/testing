mobile, and conversational apps. We power emerging startups and established
companies with the most scalable and powerful chat APIs, enabling application
product teams to drive better user engagement, and reduce time-to-market.

Customers and developers from over 50+ countries use us and love us, from online
marketplaces and eCommerce to on-demand services, to Education Tech, Health
Tech, Gaming, Live-Streaming, and more.

Our feature-rich product includes robust client-side SDKs for iOS, Android, React
Native, and Flutter. We also support popular server-side languages, a beautifully
customizable UI kit, and flexible platform APIs.

and we're bridging the gap between businesses and customers by delivering those
exact solutions.
